# Book Management Web Application

This project is a web application for managing a collection of books. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to view, add, update, and delete books. The backend is built with Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB, while the frontend is rendered dynamically using EJS templates.

## Requirements

1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Create a new Express.js application.
   - Set up the server to listen on a port of your choice.

2. **Connect to MongoDB**:
   - Connect your Express application to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

3. **Define Book Schema**:
   - Define a Mongoose schema for the book collection. Include fields for title, author, genre, and publication year.

4. **Create API Endpoints**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for managing books:
     - `GET /books`
     - `GET /books/:id`
     - `POST /books`
     - `PUT /books/:id`
     - `DELETE /books/:id`

5. **Frontend Setup with EJS**:
   - Set up EJS as the view engine for your Express application.
   - Create EJS templates for rendering dynamic views.

6. **Render Views Dynamically**:
   - Render the EJS templates with dynamic data from the backend.

7. **Implement CRUD Operations**:
   - Implement CRUD logic in the backend.
   - Ensure frontend views reflect changes in real-time.
